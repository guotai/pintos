---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

Kernel reads or write user data through pointers passed to system calls.
Before referencing any user provided pointers in system calls, the kernel 
checks whether the pointer is valid. Once the kernel makes sure the pointer
is valid, the pointer can be dereferenced to read or write user data.

A user provided pointer can be invalid in three ways: 
(a) a null pointer
(b) a pointer to kernel virtual address
(c) a pointer to unmapped virutal memory

A user provided pointer can be categorized into two types - buffer and string -
and in both cases kernel will check the invalidation cases mentioned above.
Yet the way for the (b) and (c) checking is different for buffer and string, 
which will be described in details as below.

(1) Buffer
A buffer pointer is the beginning address of a buffer with explict size, which 
is used as arguments in write and read system calls. The kernel first check 
whether the pointer is null and then check whether buffer and buffer+size are 
both within the user virtual address space. At last, the kernel makes sure each
page involved between buffer to buffer+size is "valid" by calling lookup_page
to get page table entry for the page. For read syscall, "valid" means the 
corresponding page entry is non-empty, present and of user mode. For write 
syscall, "valid" means the page entry is non-empty, present, of user mode and
writable. If any page within the buffer range is invalid, the buffer pointer
is invalid and the kernel should call exit(-1) to terminate the process.

(2) String
A string pointer is a const char * without a explict size given. It could be 
a pointer to file name or arguments, which are used in argument passing, 
exec, create, remove and open syscalls. A string is limited to PGSIZE (4KB) 
in our implementation. To check if a string pointer is valid, the kernel
first check if the pointer is null and whether it is in user virtual address
space. Since the kernel has no idea if the string spans two pages, it first 
checks whether the page the string beginning address at is valid. If it is 
not, the pointer is surely invalid. Otherwise, it could either be that the 
string's end address is within the same page as its beginning and it's valid
or the string spans two pages. Thus the kernel then checks whether the next 
page is valid. If it is not, then the string has to be in the first page with
maximum length of pg_round_up(string) - string. If the next page is also
valid, the maximum length is PGSIZE. Lastly, the kernel checks whether there 
is '\0' within the maximum length inferred above. If there is then the string
is valid, otherwise invalid (either too long or reaches invalid address). 
In any case of string invalidation, the kernel terminates the process by 
calling exit(-1).

>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room
>> for improvement in these numbers, and how much?

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system
>> call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three
>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and
>> error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary
>> function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when
>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.

Our implementation

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
